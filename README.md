# ðŸ˜¼ $LARRY Meme Engine

Welcome to the official **$LARRY Meme Engine** â€“ a creative toolkit for generating dark, funny, and symbolic memes featuring Larry, the evil cat.

This project helps you create:
- ðŸŽ­ Meme quotes

## ðŸš€ What is this?

The `$LARRY Meme Engine` is a system prompt (for ChatGPT/GPT-4o) that transforms simple inputs like:

> `"dump"`, `"Larry saw me exit early"`, or `"emotion: contempt"`

into complete **meme concepts** and **visual prompts**.

Itâ€™s designed to:
- Help artists, meme makers, and crypto degens create original content
- Generate AI-ready image descriptions (e.g. for SDXL, Replicate, DALLÂ·E)
- Expand the world of Larry through storytelling and dark humor

---

## ðŸ§° Whatâ€™s inside?

- `larry-meme-engine-system-prompt.md` â†’ the main engine logic (used in GPT-4o)
- `clean-study-moodboard-matrix.md` â†’ a reusable prompt sheet to create your own memes
- `README.md` â†’ this file!

## ðŸ§™ How do I use it?

1. Open ChatGPT (GPT-4o) or your preferred AI interface.
2. Paste the content of `larry-meme-engine-system-prompt.md` into the system message.
3. Type anything related to mood, trading, or Larry. Examples:
